I will use the 2021 Olympic dataset on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo
I will perform a descriptive analysis. The output will contain a break down
by country of medal count, gender break down, how many olympians there were per country.
I will be using R and the 'tidyverse' package to complete the analysis.
